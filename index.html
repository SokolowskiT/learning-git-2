        <h1>Creep</h1>
        <h2>by Radiohead</h2>
        <p>When you were here before<br>Couldn't look you in the eye<br>You're just like an angel<br>Your skin makes me cry</p>
        <p>You float like a feather<br>In a beautiful world<br>And I wish I was special<br>You're so fuckin' special</p>
        <p>But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.<br>What the hell am I doing here?<br>I don't belong here.</p>
        <p>I don't care if it hurts<br>I want to have control<br>I want a perfect body<br>I want a perfect soul</p>
        <p>I want you to notice<br>When I'm not around<br>You're so fuckin' special<br>I wish I was special</p>
        <p>But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.<br>What the hell am I doing here?<br>I don't belong here.</p>
        <p>She's running out again,<br>She's running out<br>She's run run run run</p>
        <p>Whatever makes you happy<br>Whatever you want<br>You're so fuckin' special<br>I wish I was special</p>
        <p>But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,<br>What the hell am I doing here?<br>I don't belong here.<br>I don't belong here.</p>
